# UMBC-E-Reader
An E-Reader coded in C++ in April 2019. This program is designed to read in a list of given books and supporting information about those books, and allow the user to create their own reading list from the imported master list. 

The user can add books to their reading list, display either the entire master list or their own reading list, and sort their reading list by book price (highest to lowest).

A sample list of books is provided to use with the program, however the program is designed to be compatable with any book list as long as it follows the formatting and order of the sample list.
